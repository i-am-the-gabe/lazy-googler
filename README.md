# lazy-googler
I made this because I was tired of behaving like a normal human being and Googling stuff with a keyboard.

## Setting it up
You need to install the [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) package.
  ```
  python -m pip install SpeechRecognition
  ```

## Using it
With the script running in the background, say "google [anything]" into your microphone.
